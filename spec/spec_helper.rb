#API Documentation | Printful

## About the Printful API  The Printful API is a RESTful API, that uses an HTTP protocol for communication. HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods are used to access the API resources.  ## Requests and responses  ### Request endpoint All API requests have to be sent to this URL: ``` https://api.printful.com/ ``` If you are using a proxy, make sure that all requests have host header set to **api.printful.com**.  ### Request parameters Some mandatory parameters (like object identifiers) must be included in the request URL path ``` GET /orders/123 ``` Additional parameters can be passed as GET variables: ``` GET /orders?offset=10&limit=5 ``` For POST and PUT requests, a more complex data structure can be passed as JSON encoded data in the request body: ``` POST /orders  {\"recipient\":{...},\"items\":[...]} ```  ### Response body The response body is always a JSON object that contains a response status code (identical to the HTTP status code) and the result of the action. If the status code is 200, then the action was successful. ``` {    \"code\": 200, //Response status code    \"result\":{       //API method return data    //...    } } ```  Sometimes the response includes paging information to allow to browse larger result sets by adding offset and limit GET parameters to the request URL. ``` {    \"code\": 200, //Response status code    \"result\":[     {        //Item 11     },     {        //Item 12     }    ]    \"paging\": {       \"total\": 12,  //Total items available       \"offset\": 10, //Items skipped from the beginning       \"limit\": 20   //Number of items per page    } } ```  ## Error response If the API call is not successful, then the response code is not in the 2xx range and the `result` attribute contains an error description. ``` {     \"code\": 404,     \"result\": \"Not Found\",     \"error\": {         \"reason\": \"NotFound\",         \"message\": \"Not Found\"     } } ```  In general, response codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (e.g. a required parameter was missing, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Printful's servers.  ### Timestamps All timestamps from the API are returned as integers in UNIX timestamp format.  ### Rate Limits Printful API has a general rate limit of 120 API calls per minute. Additionally, endpoints that perform resource intensive operations (such as mockup generator) have a lower allowed request limit.  # Authentication  <!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->

# load the gem
require 'printful_client'

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.

    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"

  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
